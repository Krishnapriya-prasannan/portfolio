      "Riddhi is a very good front-end developer. The amount of hard work she put into our Design System (building, maintaining, and polishing) is very high. I would recommend her with full confidence on any project that requires a good React developer. We've hired and fired many, but she is one of the very few that remained with us. We will hire her 100% for our next project as she is an amazing addition to any team. Don't skip on her as your next potential hire!",

She leads the project with responsibility and initiative, consistently enhancing features and offering thoughtful suggestions. Her ability to explain technical details to non-technical clients and deliver excellent demos on time is remarkable. Always supportive and collaborative, she truly elevates the team's performance. Iâ€™m grateful to have her on board!",
